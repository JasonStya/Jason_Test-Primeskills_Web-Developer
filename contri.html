                <p>The open source Axolotl API database contains tons of images and facts about axolotls, but it depends on volunteers to maintain the database. By donating axolotl pictures that you own and your
                    knowledge about axolotls, you can help spread awareness of these critically endangered amphibians. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As of August 10th 2021, 
                    the Axolotl API database contains 37 axolotl facts and over 100 axolotl pictures. 
                    See this number grow as contributions get made.

                <h2>What's the catch?</h2>
                <hr width="100%"" color="black">
                <p>The Axolotl API doesn't credit anyone in particular, by contributing to the database you give permission to have contributed images and knowledge to be shared, without credits to the contributor required. 

                    We only accept images you own, don't send us images from Google or other search engines, as they might be copyrighted.</p>

                <h2>How do I contribute?</h2>
                <hr width="100%"" color="black">
                <p>This depends on your knowledge about usage of Github. Github is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. If you don't know how to use Github, you can also contribute without Github.</p>

                <h3>Contributing with Github</h3>
                <hr width="100%"" color="black">
                <p>To contribute with Github, start by forking the repository <a href="(https://github.com/AxolotlAPI/data)">(https://github.com/AxolotlAPI/data)</a>.
                    When you've done this you can start adding axolotl facts to the facts.txt file, each fact is separated by a newline character.
                    You can also contribute pictures, to do this you should first upload the images to anywhere on the internet. 
                    After that, you can put each image's URL in pictures.txt, each image is separated by a newline character.
                    Next you should create a pull request, comparing your branch to the database's main branch. If everything seems to be alright, your pull request will be merged.
                </p>

                <h2>How can I help if I don't have axolotl pictures or facts to contribute?</h2>
                <hr width="100%"" color="black">
                <p>We'd prefer contributions to the database, this may however not always be possible. If you want to help out but have nothing to contribute, you can help by spreading the word, no matter if you're mentioning our Axolotl API or axolotls in general, the best way to help besides contributing is spreading awareness about axolotls.</p>
